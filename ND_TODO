OUTSTANDING
===========
* Rename module to spral_nd
* Split AMD into its own module spral_amd (assuming permission from Amestoy: Iain to chase)
* Sanitize function names - eg get rid of _old _new and other such confusions
* Check all subroutines are well commented
* Cull dead code in all files (do we still want cost2?)
* Maybe split main nd code into multiple files if a sensible split exists (eg hold maxflow and FM in
  separate files to aid code maintenance?)
* Comment where code came from if it is not 100% new - eg mc78 routines, coarsening etc
* See if internal subroutines would be better consildated eg remove_from_list()
  (remove use of contains within a contained subroutine and look at where some subroutines
   have same name but slightly different arguments)
* After results for report complete, check ifthere any methods we can cut completely?
* Change myreal_nested to wp (global)
* Remove kind(1.0D) .... replace with wp (the code should just need one change to
  make it single precision ie just change kind of wp). Use of real typecasting.
* Remove realval

* Fix example - remove need for data file, update to more consistent look and feel
* Fix test so it compiles without HSL dependencies (eg mc69) .. use SPRAL equivalents
* Fix test to remove need for data file
* Split test code into subroutines (see eg SSIDS for new style)
* Fix test to have meaningful output (ie print what is being tested!)


Jonathan actions:
* Review supervariable identification and possibly use other SPRAL code
* C interface (to consider: are we going to develop matlab interfaces for SPRAL?)
* Add use of ND as an option in SSIDS

DONE

Add to Makefile.am
Rename example and test to match other packages
